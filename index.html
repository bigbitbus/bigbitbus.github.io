				<h2>Did I choose the <strong>right</strong> cloud provider?</h2>
				<p>The BigBitBus API provides you with tools to compare public cloud providers and/or your private data-center cloud 
				based on Openstack, VMware and bare-metal.
				Our API provides updated performance and cost comparison information between cloud and big data/analytics providers 
				or even between your in-house private cloud and your public cloud provider of choice. 
				<p> We are not affiliated with any cloud provider and provide
				vendor-independent recommendations based only on your specific requirements.

				<h2>Should I (re-)deploy my application <strong>elsewhere</strong>?</h2>
				<p>If you also run your own data-center or private cloud then let us help you answer the question of where
				to deploy new applications or whether there is a strong business case to migrate to another cloud provider. 
				You can re-visit your decisions at any time to keep on top of rapidly evolving cloud vendors and their offerings.
				Improve application performance, cut cloud costs, and pay down technical debt while knowing that your decision making
				is grounded on reliable data.</p>
