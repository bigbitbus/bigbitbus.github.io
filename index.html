          The BigBitBus API compares public cloud providers and/or your private
          data-center cloud deployment based on Openstack, VMware, Opennebula
          and bare-metal for every application your organization has deployed.
          Get customized, data-driven recommendations about price and
          performance of your applications on different cloud providers.

        <p>
          We are not affiliated with any cloud provider and provide
          vendor-independent recommendations based only on your specific setup.

        <p>
          Cloud provider pricing, technology and trends are incredibly dynamic
          across {Infrastructure, Platform and Software}-as-services. Our API
          and professional services help you continiously track whether there is
          a strong business case to migrate some or all of your applications to
          another cloud provider and quantify the costs and opportunities at
          play for your situation. Improve application performance, adopt
          emerging architectures, and cut cloud costs while knowing that your
          decision making is grounded on reliable data.

          Can your cloud deployments be <strong>optimized</strong> to increase
          performance or decrease costs within your chosen cloud?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cloud providers are incredibly innovative and their service mix is
          constantly evolving. Your cloud service choices should be periodically
          revisited to benefit from innovation, reduce waste, and synchronize
          cloud usage with business objectives. Keep on top of changes and
          extract the maximum value from your cloud investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          BigBitBus APIs constantly export the latest performance and pricing
          information so you can track and action changes to your applications
          every time your cloud provider shifts gears. The API offers
          recommendations to optimize for cost and application performance SLAs.
          Our experts can also audit your private or public cloud applications
          and provide customized recommendations to increase your cloud RoI.
